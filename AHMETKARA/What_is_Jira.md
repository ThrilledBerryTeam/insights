## Project leader created a project and sent to us an invitation link. We get our permission to reach the project thanks to this link for contributing to the project and to see our tasks.

## Each company works with a different workflow model. One of the workflow models is determined and set for the project created by the jira admin.

## In our project, there will basically be three sections, "to do", "in progress" and "done", in accordance with the agile methodology. Afterwards, another section may be opened when deemed necessary.

## Each job written in the "to do'' section is assigned to one or more than one person. A notification will be sent to the assigned person. When the person finishes the work assigned to him, progress is made in the workflow process.
