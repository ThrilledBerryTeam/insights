# What is markdown format

*Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, used to format text and create documents for the web. It is easy to read and write, and can be converted to HTML for display on the web.*



## As a beginner, you should learn:

1. **Basic syntax:** such as headings, lists, links, images, and code blocks.
  
  Markdown uses symbols like #, , and [ ] to format text, such as headings (#), bullet points (), and links (text).

2. **Emphasis:** how to format bold and italic text.
  
  To format text in bold, you use double asterisks (text), and for italic, you use single asterisks (text).

3. **Quoting text:** how to format quoted text.
  
  To quote text, use the greater than symbol (>).

4. **Tables:** how to create tables to present data.
  
  You can create tables using a combination of dashes (-), pipes (|), and colons (:) to define the structure and alignment of table cells.

5. **Task lists:** how to create task lists using markdown syntax.
  
  You can create task lists using dashes and square brackets to define the task item, followed by a space and the word "x" inside square brackets to mark the item as complete.

6. **Keyboard shortcuts:** common keyboard shortcuts for faster markdown formatting.
   

  
  Some text editors and markdown applications offer keyboard shortcuts to make formatting easier, such as ctrl + b for bold and ctrl + i for italic.


  
*Once you understand these basic concepts, you'll have a solid foundation to start using markdown effectively.*


## Here's a detailed explanation of markdown syntax:

1. **Headings:** To create headings, use the pound (#) symbol followed by a space, with up to six pounds to define different levels of headings. For example:
  
  ```
  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  ### Heading 3
  #### Heading 4
  ##### Heading 5
  ###### Heading 6

  ```

  # Heading 1
  ## Heading 2
  ### Heading 3
  #### Heading 4
  ##### Heading 5
  ###### Heading 6
  



2. **Lists:** You can create bulleted and numbered lists in markdown by using asterisks (*) or hyphens (-) for bulleted lists, and numbers followed by a period (.) for numbered lists. For example:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

```

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item


3. **Links:** To create a link, use square brackets around the link text, followed by the URL in parentheses. For example:

```
[Google](https://www.google.com)

```

[Google](https://www.google.com)

4. **Images:** To add an image, use an exclamation point (!), followed by square brackets with the alt text and then the image URL in parentheses. For example:

```
![Alt text](image_url)

```
![MarkdownLogo](https://github.com/ahmetkaradevops/markdown/blob/2e0b46299fd7879b4f4c792462138152f5e3931e/Markdown-mark.svg.png?raw=true)

<!-- I tried to add an image using websites url which I found the this logo. I couldn't see the images. When I search the reasons, I reached out this possibilities:
 
 1. Invalid URL: Ensure that the URL is correct and that the image file is accessible at that URL.
 2. Incorrect file type: Make sure that the image file is in a format that is supported by markdown (e.g. .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif).
 3. Local file path: If the image file is stored on your local system, you cannot use the file path in a markdown file that will be rendered in a web-based environment (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Instead, you will need to upload the image to a hosting service that provides a public URL for the image.
 4. Security restrictions: Some hosting services may block the display of images from external sources for security reasons. Check with your hosting service for any restrictions or settings that may affect the display of images in markdown.
   
   If you have checked all of these possible causes and the image still will not render, you may need to try a different image URL or upload the image to a different hosting service.

At the finally, I downloand the image on my computer and i uploaded it my GitHub repo. I made it public repository. I tried to add this file. It didn't work again. I came the my mouse arrow on the picture in my github repository. I right clicked and copy the path. It worked. -->

5. **Emphasis:** To format text in bold, use double asterisks (text), and for italic, use single asterisks (text). For example:
   
   ```
   **This text is bold**
   *This text is italic*
   ```

   **This text is bold**

   *This text is italic*


6. **Code blocks:** To create a code block, use backticks (`) to define the code block. For example:

    ```
    This is a code block

    ```

7. **Quoting text:** To quote text, use the greater than symbol (>). For example:
   
   ```
   > This is a quote
    ```
    > This is a quote

8. ** Horizontal rule:** To create a horizontal rule, use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. For example:
   
   ```
   ---
   ***
   ___
    ```

---
***
___
   
9. **Tables:** To create a table, use the pipe symbol (|) to separate columns and dashes (-) to create the table header and rows. You can also specify column alignment using colons. For example:
    ```
    | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
    | Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |
    ```

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 | Row 1, Column 3 |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 | Row 2, Column 3 |

10. **Task lists:** To create a task list, use hyphens and square brackets, followed by a space and the word "x" inside square brackets to mark the item as complete. For example:
    ```
    - [x] Task 1
    - [ ] Task 2
    - [x] Task 3
    ```

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [x] Task 3
