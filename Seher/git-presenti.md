Git Overview
Git is a distributed version control system for software development that enables collaboration between multiple developers on a project. With Git, developers can track changes to the codebase, maintain different versions of the code, and easily revert to a previous version if necessary.

Key Features of Git
Distributed Version Control: Git maintains a local repository on each developer's machine, as well as a remote repository that serves as the central source of truth. Developers can commit changes to their local repository and push them to the remote repository for others to see and collaborate on.

Branching: Git allows developers to create branches, which are independent lines of development. This makes it possible to work on new features without interfering with the stable version of the code.

Reverting Changes: Git makes it easy to revert to a previous version of the code if necessary, either by checking out a specific version or by using the revert command.

Collaboration: Git enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously and merge their changes together.

Getting Started with Git
Install Git on your machine: You can download the latest version of Git from the official website (https://git-scm.com/).

Initialize a Git repository: To start using Git for your project, you need to initialize a Git repository. You can do this by navigating to the root directory of your project in the terminal and running the git init command.

Commit Changes: After making changes to the code, you need to commit them to the local repository. You can do this by running the git add command to stage the changes and then the git commit command to commit the changes with a message describing the changes.

Push Changes to the Remote Repository: When you're ready to share your changes with others, you can push them to the remote repository. You can do this by running the git push command.
